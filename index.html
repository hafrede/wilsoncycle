        <h1>ABOUT WILSON'S CYCLE</h1>
        <p>If you asked Jack Wilson 60 years ago what he wanted to do when he grew up, he without a doubt would have said, "own a bicycle shop". Although not all childhood dreams come true, fortunately Jack's did.  It took a move from Kentucky to Illinois and the Patience and support of his amazing wife Mary for this dream to come to fruition.<p>
        </p>

 

Because of his love for bikes, Jack saved $10,000 then road off with a dream in 1969.  He jammed 13 bikes into his 1967 four-door Chevy, hauled them from Champaign and carefully displayed them across the floor of an old Main Street restaurant in Mackinaw that he'd converted into his first bicycle shop.  Just a few weeks later- and just three days before his appointment to buy insurance for his new venture- that dream turned to ashes. An overnight fire wiped out everything leaving Jack and Mary with a costly and emotional decision.<p>

Over 45 years and 4 bicycle shop relocations later Jack is still at it and bigger than ever!<p>

The bicycle shop has transformed from Main Street in the small town of Mackinaw to Main Street in Downtown Bloomington boasting the largest selection of bicycles and accessories in the area with over 8000 sq ft to house it.

His contagious passion for bicycles has trickled down to his son Michael who works side by side with Jack.  With a combined experience of 84 years working on and selling bicycles, Jack and Michael are the go to guys for bicycle sales and service.
